/*
Next time, when you click on any of the cards center the card that you clicked
- make all other cards fly out to the left and right respectively animate that
- center the clicked card animate that
-  perform a zoom in style animation on the card
- that should take you the project page
- There needs to be a reverse type of animation for leaving the page
Also leave room for customization of stuff, like the colors of the background when zomming in - this is mainly so that
I can make it more class like so adding projects in the future is as simple as possible.
